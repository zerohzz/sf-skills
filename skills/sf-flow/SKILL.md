# sf-flow: Salesforce Flow Creation and Validation

Use this skill when the user needs **Flow design or Flow XML work**: record-triggered, screen, autolaunched, scheduled, or platform-event Flows, including validation, architecture choices, and safe deployment sequencing.

## Core Principles

1. **Declarative First**: Flow exists so you don't write Apex. Only escalate to Apex when Flow provably cannot handle the requirement (complex logic, callouts, high-performance needs).
2. **Bulk Safe**: All Flows must handle 200+ records per batch. Before-save Flows process records individually but record-triggered after-save Flows must handle batches.
3. **Fault Path Required**: Every DML and query element must have a fault connector — silent failures are unacceptable.
4. **One Flow Per Object Per Trigger Event**: Avoid multiple record-triggered Flows on the same object and event — use subflows for modularity instead.
5. **Evidence-Based**: Reference Salesforce Flow documentation. Flow governor limits are separate from (and cumulative with) Apex limits in the same transaction.

## Decision Gates

**AUTO** (proceed without asking):
- Standard record-triggered Flows (field updates, email alerts)
- Screen Flows for data collection
- Subflow extraction for reusability

**ASK USER** (confirm before proceeding):
- Flow vs Apex decision for complex logic
- Before-save vs After-save choice (impacts what operations are possible)
- Scheduled Flow design (impacts org limits — max 250K batches/24h)
- Platform Event-triggered Flow (asynchronous, different transaction context)

## Operating Modes

- **Quick**: Generate Flow XML from requirements, minimal validation.
- **Standard** (default): Full validation, fault paths, bulk safety review, deployment sequencing.
- **Thorough**: Enterprise-grade with performance analysis, automation density review, cross-object impact assessment.

## When This Skill Owns the Task

Use `sf-flow` when the work involves:
- `.flow-meta.xml` files
- Flow Builder architecture and XML generation
- record-triggered, screen, scheduled, autolaunched, or platform-event flows
- Flow-specific bulk safety, fault paths, and subflow orchestration

Delegate elsewhere when the user is:
- writing Apex-first automation → [sf-apex](../sf-apex/SKILL.md)
- creating objects / fields first → [sf-metadata](../sf-metadata/SKILL.md)
- deploying metadata → [sf-deploy](../sf-deploy/SKILL.md)
- seeding post-deploy test data → [sf-data](../sf-data/SKILL.md)

---

## Required Context to Gather First

Ask for or infer:
- flow type
- trigger object / entry conditions
- core business goal
- whether this is new, refactor, or repair
- target org alias if deployment or validation is needed
- whether related objects / fields already exist

---

## Recommended Workflow

### 1. Choose the right automation tool
Before building, confirm Flow is the right answer rather than:
- formula field
- validation rule
- roll-up summary
- Apex

### 2. Choose the right Flow type
| Need | Default flow type |
|---|---|
| same-record update before save | before-save record-triggered |
| related-record work / emails / callouts | after-save record-triggered |
| guided UI | screen flow |
| reusable background logic | autolaunched / subflow |
| scheduled processing | scheduled flow |
| event-driven declarative response | platform-event flow |
| AI-evaluated routing (sentiment, intent, tone) | autolaunched with AI Decision element |

### 3. Start from a template
Prefer the provided assets:
- `assets/record-triggered-before-save.xml`
- `assets/record-triggered-after-save.xml`
- `assets/screen-flow-template.xml`
- `assets/autolaunched-flow-template.xml`
- `assets/scheduled-flow-template.xml`
- `assets/platform-event-flow-template.xml`
- `assets/ai-decision-template.xml`
- `assets/subflows/`

### 4. Validate against Flow guardrails
Focus on:
- no DML in loops
- no Get Records inside loops
- proper fault paths
- correct trigger conditions
- safe subflow composition
- AI Decision elements not placed inside loops (credit cost per iteration)
- AI Decision prompts include merge field references for data context

### 5. Hand off deployment and testing
Use:
- [sf-deploy](../sf-deploy/SKILL.md) for deploy / dry-run
- [sf-data](../sf-data/SKILL.md) for high-volume test data

---

## High-Signal Rules

### Flow architecture
- before-save for same-record field updates
- after-save for related records, emails, and callouts
- do not loop over `$Record`
- use subflows when logic becomes wide or repetitive

### Bulk safety
- no DML in loops
- no Get Records in loops
- test with **251+ records** when bulk behavior matters
- prefer Transform when the job is shaping data, not per-record branching

### Error handling
- every data-changing path should have fault handling
- avoid self-referencing fault connectors
- deploy Flows as Draft first when activation risk is non-trivial

---

## Output Format

When finishing, report in this order:
1. **Flow type and goal**
2. **Files created or updated**
3. **Architecture choices**
4. **Bulk/error-handling notes**
5. **Deploy/testing next steps**

Suggested shape:

```text
Flow: <name>
Type: <flow type>
Files: <paths>
Design: <trigger choice, subflows, key decisions>
Risks: <bulk safety, fault paths, dependencies>
Next step: <dry-run deploy, activate, or test>
```

| deploy / activate flow | [sf-deploy](../sf-deploy/SKILL.md) | safe deployment sequence |
| create realistic bulk test data | [sf-data](../sf-data/SKILL.md) | post-deploy verification |
| create Apex actions / invocables | [sf-apex](../sf-apex/SKILL.md) | imperative logic |
| embed LWC in a screen flow | [sf-lwc](../sf-lwc/SKILL.md) | custom UI components |
| expose Flow to Agentforce | [sf-ai-agentscript](../sf-ai-agentscript/SKILL.md) | agent action orchestration |
