# sf-apex: Salesforce Apex Code Generation and Review

Use this skill when the user needs **production Apex**: new classes, triggers, selectors, services, async jobs, invocable methods, test classes, or evidence-based review of existing `.cls` / `.trigger` code.

## Core Principles

1. **Governor-Limit Aware**: Every suggestion considers Salesforce execution limits (100 SOQL, 150 DML, 6MB heap, 10s CPU). If a pattern risks hitting limits at scale, flag it.
2. **Bulk by Default**: All code processes `List<SObject>` — never single records. Test with 200+ records.
3. **Security First**: `WITH USER_MODE` and `with sharing` are defaults. `without sharing` or `SYSTEM_MODE` require documented justification.
4. **Evidence-Based**: Reference official Salesforce documentation. Never guess at governor limit values or API behavior.
5. **Multitenant Awareness**: Your code runs on shared infrastructure. Governor limits exist to protect all tenants — design within them, not around them.

## Decision Gates

**AUTO** (proceed without asking):
- Apex class/trigger generation following established patterns
- Test class creation for new or modified code
- Bulkification fixes for identified anti-patterns

**ASK USER** (confirm before proceeding):
- Synchronous vs asynchronous architecture choice
- `without sharing` or `SYSTEM_MODE` usage
- New trigger framework or handler pattern (when one already exists)
- Architectural changes affecting multiple classes

## Operating Modes

- **Quick**: Scaffold code fast, skip optimization, minimal error handling. Good for prototyping.
- **Standard** (default): Production-grade code with full guardrails, security, and testing guidance.
- **Thorough**: Enterprise-grade with security audit, performance analysis, governor limit calculation at expected data volumes, and cross-skill impact review.

## When This Skill Owns the Task

Use `sf-apex` when the work involves:
- Apex class generation or refactoring
- trigger design and trigger-framework decisions
- `@InvocableMethod`, Queueable, Batch, Schedulable, or test-class work
- review of bulkification, sharing, security, testing, or maintainability

Delegate elsewhere when the user is:
- editing LWC JavaScript / HTML / CSS → [sf-lwc](../sf-lwc/SKILL.md)
- building Flow XML or Flow orchestration → [sf-flow](../sf-flow/SKILL.md)
- writing SOQL only → [sf-soql](../sf-soql/SKILL.md)
- deploying or validating metadata to orgs → [sf-deploy](../sf-deploy/SKILL.md)

---

## Required Context to Gather First

Ask for or infer:
- class type: trigger, service, selector, batch, queueable, schedulable, invocable, test
- target object(s) and business goal
- whether code is net-new, refactor, or fix
- org / API constraints if known
- expected test coverage or deployment target

Before authoring, inspect the project shape:
- existing classes / triggers
- current trigger framework or handler pattern
- related tests, flows, and selectors
- whether TAF is already in use

---

## Recommended Workflow

### 1. Discover local architecture
Check for:
- existing trigger handlers / frameworks
- service-selector-domain conventions
- related tests and data factories
- invocable or async patterns already used in the repo

### 2. Choose the smallest correct pattern
| Need | Preferred pattern |
|---|---|
| simple reusable logic | service class |
| query-heavy data access | selector |
| single object trigger behavior | one trigger + handler / TAF action |
| Flow needs complex logic | `@InvocableMethod` |
| background processing | Queueable by default |
| very large datasets | Batch Apex or `Database.Cursor` patterns |
| repeatable verification | dedicated test class + test data factory |

### 3. Author with guardrails
Generate code that is:
- bulk-safe
- sharing-aware
- CRUD/FLS-safe where applicable
- testable in isolation
- consistent with project naming and layering

### 4. Validate and score
Evaluate against the 150-point rubric before handoff.

### 5. Hand off deploy/test next steps
When org validation is needed, hand off to:
- [sf-testing](../sf-testing/SKILL.md) for test execution loops
- [sf-deploy](../sf-deploy/SKILL.md) for deploy / dry-run / verification

## Generation Guardrails

Never generate these without explicitly stopping and explaining the problem:

| Anti-pattern | Why it blocks |
|---|---|
| SOQL in loops | governor-limit failure |
| DML in loops | governor-limit failure |
| missing sharing model | security / data exposure risk |
| hardcoded IDs | deployment and portability failure |
| empty `catch` blocks | silent failure / poor observability |
| string-built SOQL with user input | injection risk |
| tests without assertions | false-positive test suite |

Default fix direction:
- query once, operate on collections
- use `with sharing` unless justified otherwise
- use bind variables and `WITH USER_MODE` where appropriate
- create assertions for positive, negative, and bulk cases

See [references/anti-patterns.md](references/anti-patterns.md) and [references/security-guide.md](references/security-guide.md).

## High-Signal Build Rules

### Trigger architecture
- Prefer **one trigger per object**.
- If TAF is already installed and used, extend it instead of inventing a second trigger pattern.
- Triggers should delegate logic; avoid heavy business logic directly in trigger bodies.

### Async choice
| Scenario | Default |
|---|---|
| standard async work | Queueable |
| very large record processing | Batch Apex |
| recurring schedule | Scheduled Flow or Schedulable |
| post-job cleanup | Finalizer |
| long-running Lightning callouts | `Continuation` |

### Testing minimums
Use the **PNB** pattern for every feature:
- **Positive** path
- **Negative** / error path
- **Bulk** path (251+ records where relevant)

### Modern Apex expectations
Prefer current idioms when available:
- safe navigation: `obj?.Field__c`
- null coalescing: `value ?? fallback`
- `Assert.*` over legacy assertion style
- `WITH USER_MODE` and explicit security handling where relevant

## Output Format

When finishing, report in this order:
1. **What was created or reviewed**
2. **Files changed**
3. **Key design decisions**
4. **Risk / guardrail notes**
5. **Test guidance**
6. **Deployment guidance**

Suggested shape:

```text
Apex work: <summary>
Files: <paths>
Design: <pattern / framework choices>
Risks: <security, bulkification, async, dependency notes>
Tests: <what to run / add>
Deploy: <dry-run or next step>
```

## LSP Validation Note

This skill supports an LSP-assisted authoring loop for `.cls` and `.trigger` files:
- syntax issues can be detected immediately after write/edit
- the skill can auto-fix common syntax errors in a short loop
- semantic quality still depends on the 150-point review rubric

## Cross-Skill Integration

| Need | Delegate to | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| describe objects / fields first | [sf-metadata](../sf-metadata/SKILL.md) | avoid coding against wrong schema |
| seed bulk or edge-case data | [sf-data](../sf-data/SKILL.md) | create realistic test datasets |
| run Apex tests / fix failing tests | [sf-testing](../sf-testing/SKILL.md) | execute and iterate on failures |
| deploy to org | [sf-deploy](../sf-deploy/SKILL.md) | validation and deployment orchestration |
| build Flow that calls Apex | [sf-flow](../sf-flow/SKILL.md) | declarative orchestration |
| build LWC that calls Apex | [sf-lwc](../sf-lwc/SKILL.md) | UI/controller integration |
